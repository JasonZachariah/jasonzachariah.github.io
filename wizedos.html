                                This project was assigned to me during my time at WizRobotics. They wanted to revamp a
                                website for their service, <a class="underlinelink" href="https://www.wizedos.com/">WizEdOS, an all-in-one learning platform for STEM
                                    educators</a>
                                to create, host, and track content for STEM learning.

                                Initially, when discussing the needs of the project, it was thought that a simple
                                redesign was. However, after analyzing the website and discussing long-term goals for
                                the website, there was a large disconnect between the current structure and the goals
                                that needed to be fulfilled

                            Many of the images used were stock illustrations that were inconsistent and did not help

                            The ordering of the page content was inconsistent, and much vital information was placed in
                            a hard-to-reach area. For example, the pricing section was placed in a separate tab, making
                            it difficult for users to navigate.

                <p>

                    I started with a wireframe that broke each major section of the website into its separate chunks,
                    such as testimonials and pricing. In this way, the client and I could rearrange the sections in
                    different ways and understand what key points, and have a better way to organize and layout the
                    different areas of the website.

                <p>The current flow is spread throughout multiple platforms, requiring users to frequently switch
                    between them. To fix this, I created a flow that combines these categories into a single,
                    cohesive experience, allowing users to transition between flows on one platform easily.</p>

                    Since I wanted to test a wide scope of features to improve the work, I gave my mid-fidelity

                    lacked
                    necessary information, such as when the course was being offered. Based on this
                    feedback, I
                    created a final version with better-organised cards and a labelling system to specify if
                    courses
                    fit certain requirements.

                        Based on testing two major styles for the main home page, the final version allowed for
                        more of
