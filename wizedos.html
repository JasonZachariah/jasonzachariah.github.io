                    <h4>Overview</h4>

                    <h3>WizEdOS, a B2B service for STEM education, lacked a consistent design system that alienated
                        new businesses from their platform.</h3>

                    <p>
                        During my time at WizRobotics, I had the opportunity to create a new direction for
                        <span><a class="underlinelink" href="https://www.wizedos.com/">WizEdOS, an all-in-one learning
                                platform for STEM educators.</a></span> Initially, when discussing the project's scope,
                        the client believed that only a simple visual refresh with a few minor website edits was needed.
                        However, after analyzing the site and discussing long-term goals for the service, it became
                        clear
                        that there was a major disconnect between the existing design and the changes truly necessary.
                    </p>

                <div id="step2">
                    <h4>Initial Notes</h4>

                    <h3>So, what were the issues with the old WizEdOS system?</h3>

                    <p>After reviewing the initial website with the client, these were the main pain points that
                        emerged:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Inconsistent Branding</b></li>
                        <p>
                            Many images on the website were random stock illustrations that failed to communicate the
                            company’s services. As a result, the site felt disjointed and gave off an unprofessional
                            impression.
                        </p>

                        <li><b>Confusing Page Setup</b></li>
                        <p>
                            Important sections such as the booking form were placed in hard-to-access areas, making it
                            difficult for users to locate key actions quickly.
                        </p>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        With a clear understanding of what needed improvement, I began the research and development
                        phase.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div id="step3" class="space-y-8">
                    <h4>Creating the Flows</h4>
                    <h3>Treat the website layout like a conversation</h3>

                    <div>

                        <p>
                            To get a clearer idea of how to structure the website that would satisfy the client, I had
                            them
                            "pitch" me the WizEdOS service as if I were another business
                            . Using this method, I was able to identify natural ways to group content, taking notes on
                            major
                            points and structuring them based on how the client explained the platform.
                        </p>



                        <p>
                            This process allowed us to find what aspects of the website needed to be added, and how we
                            should organize them by pages.
                        </p>



                        <p> From this, we identified two main user flows for the WizEdOS website:
                            to encourage companies to book a meeting, and second, to showcase the four sub-services
                            of WizEdOS.</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
                        <img class="greyborder child col-span-3" style="width: 100%;"
                            src="images/wizedos/InformationArchitecture.png">
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            For the first flow, this was achieved by adding a CTA button in both the hero section and
                            the
                            navigation bar. This opened a pop-up modal, allowing users to access the booking flow easily
                            without it disrupting the users flow like it did before
                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <img class="greyborder" src="images/wizedos/HeroSection.png">

                    <h4>Takeaways</h4>
                    <h3>Work with your client, not against them</h3>

                    <p>
                        What made this process successful was maintaining transparency and involving the client in
                        design
                        decisions. Allowing them to understand why each choice was made helped minimize revisions later
                        and ensured we were aligned on the final deliverables.
