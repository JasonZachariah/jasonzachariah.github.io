                        <h3>WizEdOS had a problem- their website failed to communicate the value of their service.</h3>

                        <p>
                            During my time at WizRobotics, I had the opportunity to create a new direction for
                            <span><a class="underlinelink" href="https://www.wizedos.com/">WizEdOS, an all-in-one
                                    learning
                                    platform for STEM educators.</a></span> Initially, when discussing the project's
                            scope,
                            the client believed that only a simple visual refresh with a few minor website edits was
                            needed.
                            However, after analyzing the site and discussing long-term goals for the service, it became
                            clear
                            that there was a major disconnect between the existing design and the changes truly
                            necessary.
                        </p>

                        <h3>So, what were the issues with the old WizEdOS system?</h3>

                        <p>After reviewing the initial website with the client, these were the main pain points that
                            emerged:</p>


                    </div>
                    <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 full">
                        <div class="space-y-4 greyborder p-4 flex-1">
                            <p><b>Inconsistent Branding</b></p>
                            <p>
                                Many images on the website were random stock illustrations that failed to communicate
                                the
                                company's services. As a result, the site felt disjointed and gave off an unprofessional
                                impression.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="space-y-4 greyborder p-4 flex-1">
                            <p><b>Confusing Page Setup</b></p>
                            <p>
                                Important sections such as the booking form were placed in hard-to-access areas, making
                                it
                                difficult for users to locate key actions quickly.

                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        With a clear understanding of what needed improvement, I began the research and development
                        phase.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="space-y-4" id="step3">
                    <h4>Creating the Flows</h4>
                    <div class="space-y-4 content-width">
                        <h3>Treat the website layout like a conversation</h3>

                        <p>
                            To get a clearer idea of how to structure the website that would satisfy the client, I had
                            them
                            "pitch" me the WizEdOS service as if I were another business
                            . Using this method, I was able to identify natural ways to group content, taking notes on
                            major
                            points and structuring them based on how the client explained the platform.
                        </p>



                        <p>
                            This process allowed us to find what aspects of the website needed to be added, and how we
                            should organize them by pages.
                        </p>



                        <p> From this, we identified two main user flows for the WizEdOS website:
                            to encourage companies to book a meeting, and second, to showcase the four sub-services
                            of WizEdOS.</p>

                    </div>

                    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
                        <img class="greyborder child col-span-3 my-4 full" style="width: 100%;"

                    <div class="space-y-4">
                        <p>
                            For the first flow, this was achieved by adding a CTA button in both the hero section and
                            the
                            navigation bar. This opened a pop-up modal, allowing users to access the booking flow easily
                            without it disrupting the users flow like it did before
                        </p>

                        <p>
                           Maintaining transparency and involving the client in design decisions helped minimize revisions later and ensured we were aligned on the final deliverables.
                        </p>

                       Adapting the existing brand identity to a flexible design system helped create a cohesive and consistent brand. This helped the client understand the value of the design system and how it would benefit the company in the long run.
