                    <h4>Overview</h4>

                    <h3>WizEDOS, a b2b serivce for STEM education, lacked a consistent design system that alieneted
                        new businesses from their platform </h3>

                    <p>

                        During my time at WizRobotics,I had the chance to create a new direction for <span> <a
                                class="underlinelink" href="https://www.wizedos.com/"> WizEdOS, an all-in-one learning
                                platform for STEM educators. </a>
                        </span> Initially, when discussing the scope of the project, the client just thought a
                        simple visual refresh
                        was needed, with some minor edits to the website. However, after analyzing the website and discussing long-term goals
                        for
                        the service, there was a large disconnect with what changes were nessary for the service.

                </div>
                <div class="space-y-4 " id="step2">

                    <div class="space-y-4 " id="step2">
                        <h4>inital notes</h4>

                        <div>
                            <h3>So,what were the issues with the old WizEdOS system. </h3>

                            <p> After reviewing the intial website together with the client,here were the key pain
                                points
                                that were mentioned:
                            </p>


                            <ol>
                                <li>Inconsistent Branding</li>
                                <p>

                                    Many of the images used in the website random stock illustrations that did not
                                    communicate the services provided. As a result, the website did not look cohesive,
                                    giving the website a "cheap" image.


                                </p>

                                <li>Confusing Page Setup</li>
                                <p>

                                    Many important sections of the website, such as the booking form, were placed in
                                    hard to acess regions, making it harder for users to locate key actions quickly.

                                </p>
                            </ol>

                            <p> Since we now had a common understanding of what elements of the website needed changing,
                                I could now start the research and devlopment phase of this project.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                    </div>


                    <div class="space-y-4 " id="step3">

                        <h4>Creating the Flows</h4>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Treat the website layout like a converstation</h3>
                        </div>
                        <div>

                            <p>
                                With this method, I was able to naturally find ways to group content, making notes on
                                the
                                major points, and grouping them together based on the way he broke down he explanation.
                            </p>

                            <p> In this way, we naturally found ways to group content together, allowing for a more
                                structure in the website. These note nataed allowed for more ease of access when moving
                                on
                                to to the wireframing, creating less revison work later on in the process.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                        <div>




                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>From this, we came to two major flows for the WizEdOS website. First, to get companies to
                                book a
                                meeting. And secondly, to show of the four subservices of WizEdOs</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="">

                        <p>

                            For the first flow, this was achived by adding a CTA button in the hero section as well
                            as
                            the nav
                            bar of the website, which would open a pop-up modal, allowing for users to easily acess
                            the
                            flow
                            without having to search for it.



                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <img class="greyborder" src="images/wizedos/HeroSection.png">


                    <h4>Takeaways</h4>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Work with your client, not against them</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div>

                        <p>
                            What made the design process move smoothly was the transparency of the design process,
                            having the
                            client have a direct look into why I made certain design decisions. This allowed for
                            fewer
                            changes
                            later on in the process, and caused both of us to be clear on what was being delivered.
