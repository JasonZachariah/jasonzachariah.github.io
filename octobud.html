                    <h3>Technology in the classroom divides more than it provides</h3>

                    <p>

                        With more than 43% of Gen Alpha owning some form of technology before kindergarten, kids are
                        becoming more accustomed to technology in their daily life, including their education. However,
                        with the rise of Chromebooks or iPads in the classroom, which lack proper ways of fostering
                        a cooperative learning environment, there now exists a barrier between students and teachers
                        when it comes to learning.
                    </p>

                    <p> The question then becomes <b>how do we allow students to be focused using
                            technology while also making it easy and flexible for teachers to use?</b></p>
                </div>
                <div class="space-y-4" id="step2">

                    <h4>Research</h4>

                    <p>


                        I interviewed 6 tutors and teachers who taught children between 5-15, 4 of whom primarily taught
                        students online(Google Meet,Zoom etc) and 2 of whom taught in person.

                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <h3 class="mt-0">Children work better when they are engaged</h3>
                        <p>
                            Both online teachers and in-person teachers found that students worked better when they
                            found ways to make the lesson more gamified, such as introducing Kahoots or cooperative
                            learning scenarios.
                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3> Tried and true> expensive and new</h3>
                        <p>


                            Both online and in-person teachers shared how important lesson plans are to create a planned
                            learning environment, especially with larger classes. Even if less engaging, having a
                            template design is less expensive and easier to implement across their classroom.


                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Online learning creates barriers than can't be resolved</h3>
                        <p>


                            A common pain point shared by all the online teachers was the lack of control. Since they
                            can't physically stop them from misusing their devices, a lot of their power in teaching is
                            dependent on student behaviour.

                    <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>




                    <p>

                        I analysed the three most common tools design students use to plan out their degree on their
                        strengths and weaknesses.Each platform had only one or two strong features present. This
                        reinforces frustrations noted in the user survey about having to cycle through multiple
                        platforms to plan their degree.

                    <h3>Realizing the design</h3>
                    <p>
                        When finding the optimal design for the octobud, considerations had to be made on how to balance
                        the input and output system to be simple and obvious enough for a child to use it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Connection to existing platforms</h3>

                    <p>

                        Since people, thre would be no immediate roll over to the platform, so adding a function
                        where
                        changes in the could sync up would also imporve productivity. By allowing DESNbook to be
                        the hub
                        of descions, it would futher speed up course planning time fore students, and avoid
                        human err
                        when consulting other course resources.

                    </p>

                    <h4>Takeaways</h4>

                    <h3>Don't reinvent the wheel</h3>


                    <p>
                        My early designs were focused on creating something that looked nice before consider
                        how
                        the
                        user
                        would use it. By focusing on the issues of users journey and allowing feedback from
                        students
                        on my
                        designs, the ending product allowed for an experience catered toward those who would
                        use
                        it.
