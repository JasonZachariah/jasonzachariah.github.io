                    <h4>Overview</h4>

                    <h3>Technology in the classroom divides more than it connects.</h3>

                    <p>
                        With more than 43% of Gen Alpha owning some form of technology before kindergarten, children are
                        becoming increasingly accustomed to using technology in their daily lives—including their
                        education. However, with the rise of Chromebooks and iPads in classrooms, which lack effective
                        ways to foster a cooperative learning environment, a barrier has emerged between students and
                        teachers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The question then becomes: <b>How do we help students stay focused using technology while also
                            making it flexible and intuitive for teachers to use?</b>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="space-y-4" id="step2">
                    <h4>Research</h4>

                    <p>
                        I interviewed six tutors and teachers who taught children aged 5-15. Four primarily taught
                        students online (via Google Meet, Zoom, etc.), while two taught in person.
                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3 class="mt-0">Children work better when they're engaged.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Both online and in-person teachers found that students performed better when lessons were
                            gamified—using tools like Kahoot or collaborative learning activities.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Tried and true > expensive and new.</h3>
                        <p>
                            Both groups of teachers emphasized the importance of structured lesson plans to maintain a
                            consistent learning environment, especially in larger classes. Even if less exciting,
                            reusable templates are cost-effective and easier to implement across classrooms.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h3>Online learning creates barriers that can't be fully solved.</h3>
                        <p>
                            A major pain point for online teachers was the lack of control. Since they can't physically
                            monitor students' device use, much of their classroom management depends on student
                            behavior.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>


                <div class="space-y-4 colorbg" id="step3">

                    <h3>Realizing the design</h3>
                    <p>
                        When developing the optimal design for Octobud, careful consideration was given to balancing the
                        input and output systems. The goal was to make them simple and intuitive enough for children to
                        understand while maintaining functionality for teachers.

                    <h4>Next Steps</h4>

                    <h3>Connecting to existing platforms</h3>

                    <p>
                        Since not all classrooms would immediately transition to this system, adding synchronization
                        features with existing tools would improve adoption. By allowing Octobud to integrate with
                        established educational platforms, teachers could streamline lesson management and reduce errors
                        caused by switching between tools.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Takeaways</h4>

                    <h3>Don't reinvent the wheel</h3>

                    <p>
                        My early designs focused too heavily on aesthetics instead of usability. By shifting focus to
                        the user journey and incorporating student feedback throughout the process, the final design
                        evolved into a product tailored to real classroom needs.
