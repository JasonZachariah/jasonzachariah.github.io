                    <h4>The Problem</h4>
                    <h3>Technology in the classroom divides more than it provides</h3>
                    <p>

                        With more than 43% of Gen Alpha owning some form of technology before kindergarten, kids are
                        becoming more accustomed to technology in their daily life, including their education. However,
                        with the prevalence of methods such as Chromebooks or iPads, which lack proper ways of fostering
                        a cooperative learning environment, there now exists a barrier between students and teachers
                        when it comes to learning. So, <b>how do we allow students to be motivated using
                            technology while also allowing teachers to maintain a flexible and easy-to-maintain way of
                            teaching?</b>
                    </p>

                </div>
            </section>
            <section class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4" id="step2">

                <div class="items-center ">

                    <p>


                        I interviewed 6 tutors and teachers who taught children between 5-15, 4 of whom primarily taught
                        students online(Google Meet,Zoom etc) and 2 of whom taught in person.

                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-span-2 ">

                    <div>
                        <h3 class="mt-0">Children work better when they are engaged</h3>
                        <p>

                            Both online teachers and in-person teachers found that students worked better when they
                            found ways to make the lesson more gamified, such as introducing Kahoots or cooperative
                            learning scenarios.
                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3> Tried and true> expensive and new</h3>
                        <p>


                            Both online and in-person teachers shared how important lesson plans are to create a planned
                            learning environment, especially with larger classes. Even if less engaging, having a
                            template design is less expensive and easier to implement across their classroom.


                        </p>

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h3>Online learning creates barriers than can't be resolved</h3>
                        <p>


                            A common pain point shared by all the online teachers was the lack of control. Since they
                            canâ€™t physically stop them from misusing their devices, a lot of their power in teaching is
                            dependent on student behaviour.

                <h4>Realizing the design
                </h4>
                <p>

                    When finding the optimal design for the octobud, considerations had to be made on how to balance the
                    input and output system to be <b>simple and obvious enough for a child to use it.</b>
                </p>

                </h4>
                <h3>Code Card System</h3>
                <p>


                    The <b>octobud code system</b> allows for flexible learning scenarios that can easily be changed out
                    by
                    simply switching the cards with codes. Since the cards hold the lesson for the octobud, creating a
                    new lesson plan, teachers simply have to print. Whether it be a fun interactive storybook or a math
                    sheet, the octobud code allows for flexible learning that is easy for teachers to mass produce and
                    plan out without having to worry about the budget.

                    <p>Since the goal of the octobud is to promote flexible work, an important extension would be a
                        webservice that allowed teachers to easily place and keep track of the students' use of their
                        octobud device. This would also have the additional benefit of having a way to plot student
                        learning so that teachers can see how engaged they are with their teaching, </p>
