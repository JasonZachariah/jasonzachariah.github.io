                    <h3>

                        During my time at WizRobotics, I was assigned to work with an front-end developer on a platform
                        to help redesign their platform for Wiz Parser, an online interactive teaching platform.

                    </h3>
                    <p>


                        The current developer I was working with had no system in place for designing the different
                        modules for the Wiz Parser, "designing" the modules as they were needed.


                    </p>

                <div class="space-y-4" id="step2">


                    <h4>So,what was the problem with the Wiz Parser</h4>


       

                    <h3> Lack of unity creates confusion</h3>

                    <p>

                        Due to not having a system for creating the elements in the Wiz Parser, the platform lacks
                        consistency both in looks and interactivity. Not only did this look visually unappealing, but it
                        created confusion on the end points for each module, creating no distinction between a marked vs
                        unmarked module.

                    </p>

                    <h3> Creating new elements is time consuming</h3>
                    <p>

                        One complaint that I got from the engineer was how annoying it was to create new elements for
                        the module, as he had to code the CSS for each module from scratch and make sure it didn't
                        interfere with other modules. This new system had to be flexible, and not interfere with the
                        existing coding system in place.

                    <h4>Research and devlopment</h4>




                   <p>
                    After consulting with the front-end developer about the needed elements in this program, we pinpointed 3 core groups of the modules:
                   </p>
                   <ol>
                    <li>Non-interactive elements (text, headers, images)
                    </li>
                    <li>Interactive, non-graded elements (charts, flashcards, numberlines)
                    </li>
                    <li>Interactive, non-graded elements (short answers, headers, images)
                    </li>
                   </ol>

                   <p>
                    In thi
                   </p>

                            Since people, thre would be no immediate roll over to the platform, so adding a function
                            where
                            changes in the could sync up would also imporve productivity. By allowing DESbook to be
                            the hub
                            of descions, it would futher speed up course planning time fore students, and avoid
                            human err
                            when consulting other course resources.

                        <h3>Don't reinvent the wheel</h3>


                        <p>
                            My early designs were focused on creating something that looked nice before consider
                            how
                            the
                            user
                            would use it. By focusing on the issues of users journey and allowing feedback from
                            students
                            on my
                            designs, the ending product allowed for an experience catered toward those who would
                            use
                            it.
