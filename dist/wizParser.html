                    <h3>The Issue</h3>
                    <p>

                        During my time at WizRobotics, I was assigned to work with an front-end developer on a platform
                        to help redesign their platform for Wiz Parser, an online interactive teaching platform.

                    </p>
                    <p>


                        The current developer I was working with had no system in place for designing the different
                        modules for the Wiz Parser, "designing" the modules as they were needed.


                    </p>

                <div class="space-y-8" id="step2">


                    <h4>So,what was the problem with the Wiz Parser</h4>




                    <h3> Lack of unity creates confusion</h3>

                    <p>

                        Due to not having a system for creating the elements in the Wiz Parser, the platform lacks
                        consistency both in looks and interactivity. Not only did this look visually unappealing, but it
                        created confusion on the end points for each module, creating no distinction between a marked vs
                        unmarked module.

                    <h3> Creating new elements is time consuming</h3>
                    <p>

                        One complaint that I got from the engineer was how annoying it was to create new elements for
                        the module, as he had to code the CSS for each module from scratch and make sure it didn't
                        interfere with other modules. This new system had to be flexible, and not interfere with the
                        existing coding system in place.

                    <h3>Perfecting handoff </h3>
                    <p>
                        Since I was creating a system for a team with little experience in Figma, my system had to be
                        easily translatable for the development stage and cover all bases to ensure that a consistent
                        system is followed throughout. To achieve this, I create a detailed manual list of all
                        components and variants, which helps create a smoother handoff experience during the design
                        process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are some of the details I formatted before handoff:

                    <h3>Typography</h3>
                    <p>
                        Typography guidelines were important to establish, especially when relating to creating type
                        hierarchy that would work both on desktop and mobile devices. Previously, type styles were used
                        based on style, rather than purpose,leading to time wasted when encoding into CSS . By labelling
                        them with titles to show what they were for, it allowed developers to understand where to use
                        each style in the future

                    <h3>Colours</h3>
                    <p>

                        To make a color schematic that worked for light and dark mode and was easily able to be
                        implemented coding wise, the primary and neutral palette was defined using the Radix colour
                        system, which could be easily implemented into the code of the Parser. After this, status
                        colours for alerts were defined, both for light and dark mode.

                        After consulting with the front-end developer about the needed elements in this program, we
                        pinpointed 3 core groups of the modules:

                    <p>


                        One of the biggest challenges when designing this system was making it actually practical for
                        the workflow of the developers using it, especially for those using it in the future when I am
                        not there to give feedback. This is why it was so valuable to have the developer with me to pass
                        along feedback and questions he had about the design, and plan for all edge cases of the design
                        that he might encounter, and not just assume everything I create would turn out smoothly.
