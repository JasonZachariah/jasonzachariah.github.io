                    <h3>Inconsistent, divided platforms </h3>
                    <p>The DESN Program is a 120-credit program requiring students to plan their courses according to
                        requirements. However, there doesn't exist no system to plan out the degree, requiring students
                        to refer to multiple sources to confirm their degree. This fragmented approach can lead to
                        miscommunication and cause human error in meeting degree requirements.</p>
                    <h4>Solution</h4>
                    <h3>One dashboard, for all your course planning needs </h3>

                    <p>A live digital planner that tracks DESN requirements, allowing students to manage course
                        planning, view potential schedules, and address any issues in one place.

                <p>

                    Based on my research, I developed a mid-fidelity prototype of a dashboard that met the
                    revised user journey, allowing for access to all the major flows from the home dashboard.

            <div class="col-span-3 md:col-start-2  md:col-span-2">
                <p>The current flow is spread throughout multiple platforms, requiring users to frequently switch
                    between them. To fix this, I created a flow that combines these categories into a single,
                    cohesive experience, allowing users to transition between flows on one platform easily.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Observations</h3>
            <div class="col-span-3 md:col-span-2">

                <p>

                    Since I wanted to test a wide scope of features to improve the work, I gave my mid-fidelity
                    to 3 design students who hadn't used the app, and asked them to :



                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li> Add a course to their year one schedule</li>
                    <li> Check what credits they need completed
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Make a timetable for a year.

                    </li>
                </ol>


                <p>
                    Since these three flows were the most important to design students, my focus was to
                    make
                    these
                    flows
                    as simple and intuitive as possible.

                <p>

                    User testing highlighted that the information on the course cards was not intuitive and
                    lacked
                    necessary information, such as when the course was being offered. Based on this
                    feedback, I
                    created a final version with better-organised cards and a labelling system to specify if
                    courses
                    fit certain requirements.

                    Users expressed a desire for the sidebar to be more useful. Early versions displayed
                    only credit
                    information without suggestions for improvements or additional courses. Suggested
                    changes were
                    implemented to help users easily identify and resolve issues with a click.

                    Since people, thre would be no immediate roll over to the platform, so adding a function
                    where
                    changes in the could sync up would also imporve productivity. By allowing DESbook to be
                    the hub
                    of descions, it would futher speed up course planning time fore students, and avoid
                    human err
                    when consulting other course resources.

                    My early designs were focused on creating something that looked nice before consider how the user
                    would use it. By focusing on the issues of users journey and allowing feedback from students on my
                    designs, the ending product allowed for an experience catered toward those who would use it.
