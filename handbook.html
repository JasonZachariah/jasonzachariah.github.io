                                To understand the pain points design students faces, I surveyed 15 current DESN students
                                to

                                separate processes to plan their program,creating a split task flow that has a higher

                        I analysed the three most common tools design students use to plan out their degree-

                        <b> Visual Student Planner, DESN requirements sheet, and digital planners like Notion</b>- and
                        found their ability to complete tasks design students require to plan their degree.

                    Each platform had only one or two strong features, forcing students to use multiple platforms to
                    meet their needs. This reinforces frustrations noted in user surveys, highlighting that the main
                    issue with course selection is this split-up user experiences

                <p>

                    Based on my research, I developed a mid-fidelity prototype of a dashboard that met the
                    revised user journey, allowing for access to all the major flows from the home dashboard.

                <p>The current flow is spread throughout multiple platforms, requiring users to frequently switch
                    between them. To fix this, I created a flow that combines these categories into a single,
                    cohesive experience, allowing users to transition between flows on one platform easily.</p>
            </div>
            <h3>Observations</h3>
            <div class="col-span-3 md:col-span-2">

                <p>

                    Since I wanted to test a wide scope of features to improve the work, I gave my mid-fidelity
                    to 3 design students who hadn't used the app, and asked them to :



                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li> Add a course to their year one schedule</li>
                    <li> Check what credits they need completed
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Make a timetable for a year.

                    </li>
                </ol>


                <p>
                    Since these three flows were the most important to design students, my focus was to
                    make
                    these
                    flows
                    as simple and intuitive as possible.

                <p>

                    User testing highlighted that the information on the course cards was not intuitive and
                    lacked
                    necessary information, such as when the course was being offered. Based on this
                    feedback, I
                    created a final version with better-organised cards and a labelling system to specify if
                    courses
                    fit certain requirements.

                    My early designs were focused on creating something that looked nice before consider how the user
                    would use it. By focusing on the issues of users journey and allowing feedback from students on my
                    designs, the ending product allowed for an experience catered toward those who would use it.
