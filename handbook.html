                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <h3>Planning out courses for the DESN program is a hassle.</h3>

                    <p>
                        As a design student in the DESN program, one area I dreaded was planning my courses - especially
                        in my first year.
                        The DESN Program is a 120-credit program that requires students to plan out their courses to fit
                        the requirements. However, the resources used to help students require students to reference
                        multiple sources of information.

                    </p>



                </div>
                <div class="colorbg">
                    <h4>HMW STATEMENT</h4>
                    <h3>How do we make the process of planning out and understanding DESN requirements a simplified,
                        single experience?
                    </h3>
                </div>
                <div class="space-y-4" id="step2">
                    <h4>Initial Research</h4>
                    <h3>To understand the pain points of degree planning, I surveyed 15 current DESN students.</h3>
                    <p>
                        This helped me understand their experiences when planning their degrees. I asked a mix of
                        qualitative and quantitative questions to pinpoint what made course planning difficult.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based on these interviews, here are the major pain points identified:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Confusion over course requirements</li>
                        <p>
                            The current design handbook lacks support for showing how courses affect degree progress.
                            <b>53% of students had trouble keeping track of course requirements</b>, and <b>46% wished
                                they had a real-time degree requirement checker.</b>
                        </p>

                        <li>Planning your degree is tedious</li>
                        <p>
                            The current process requires students to use three separate systems, creating a fragmented
                            workflow prone to errors. <b>Over 25% of students rely on third-party tools</b> (Notion,
                            Excel, etc.) to ensure accuracy.
                        </p>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
                    <p>
                        I analyzed the three most common tools design students use to plan their degrees, focusing on
                        their strengths and weaknesses. While each app had one or two strong core features, none
                        supported the full journey needed. This reinforced survey feedback about the frustration of
                        switching between multiple platforms.

                        <p>
                            Currently, there is no unified site to plan out the degree. Students must navigate
                            multiple platforms to meet requirements, often leading to miscommunication and a
                            disjointed user experience.

                    <h3>Re-evaluating the User Journey</h3>
                    <p>
                        The current design journey is comprised of three seprate flows- one for checking degree
                        requirements, one for checking availability of courses, and one for plotting their timetables.
                        This split-up system creates potential for miscommunication and a chance for students to fail to
                        maintain degree requirements.

                    </p>
                    <img class="greyborder" src="images/handbook/currentjourney.png">
                    <p>
                        To fix this, the new flow should allow for students to easily change between each flow, allowing
                        for a single experience and prevent user error.

                    </p>
                    <img class="greyborder" src="images/handbook/revisedjourney.png">

                    <p>
                        After finalizing this new system, I could now start designing the mid-fidelity screens.

                        <h3>Mid-Fidelity to Hi-Fidelity</h3>
                        <p>
                            Based on my research, I developed a mid-fidelity prototype that addressed the revised user
                            journey, consolidating all major flows into a single dashboard. The dashboard used a central
                            sidbar system to allow users to navigate between their diffrent flows, and
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            To test the prototype, I asked three design students who hadn't used the app to:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Add a course to their first-year schedule.</li>
                            <li>Check which credits they still needed.</li>
                            <li>Create a timetable for one year.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Since these three flows were most important to students, my goal was to make them as simple and
                            intuitive as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p>Here are the insights gained from this testing:</p>

                        <p>
                            User testing showed that course cards lacked clarity and essential details, such as when a
                            course was offered. Based on feedback, I redesigned the cards with clearer organization and
                            added labels to show which requirements each course fulfills.

                            Since users wouldn't transition to a new platform immediately, a sync function with existing
                            systems would improve productivity. Making DESNbook the central hub for planning would speed up
                            workflows and reduce human error when cross-referencing resources.

                            My early designs focused on aesthetics rather than usability. By prioritizing user journeys and
                            incorporating feedback from real students, the final product delivers an experience tailored to
                            those who will actually use it.
