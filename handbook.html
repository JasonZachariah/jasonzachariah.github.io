                        <p>
                            To understand the issues design students faces, I surveyed 15 current DESN students to
                            understand their expeirnce wwhen planning out their degree.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here is what I gained:
                        </p>
                        <h3>Confusion over course requirements</h3>
                        <p>
                            The current Design handbook lacks support to showing how courses affect their degree, with
                            <b>53% of having trouble keeping track of course requirments</b>, and <b>46% wishing they
                                had a
                                real-time degree requirements checker</b>


                        </p>
                        <h3>Planning your degree is tedious.</h3>
                        <p>
                            The current system of planning out the degree requires students to go through
                            3
                            separate processes to plan their program,creating a split task flow that has a higher rate
                            of miscommunication.<b> Over 25% of students say they have to rely on other schedule
                                trackers </b>(Notion,Excel etc)to keep track of the 3 diffrent task flows
                            .

                    <h3>What do design students use?</h3>
                    <p>

                        I researched the three most common tools design students use to plan out their degree-

                        <b> Visual Student Planner, DESN requirements sheet, and digital planners like Notion</b>- and
                        found if they met all the necessary requirements of the user.

                <div class="col-span-2">

                    <p>

                        Each platform had only one or two strong features, forcing students to use multiple platforms to
                        meet their needs. This reinforces frustrations noted in user surveys, highlighting that the main
                        issue with course selection is this split-up user experience.

                    <div>
                        <p>

                            Since I wanted to test a wide scope of features to improve the work, I gave my
                            mid-fidelity
                            to 3
                            design students who hadn't used the app, and asked them to :

                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Add a course to their year one schedule</li>
                            <li> Check what credits they need completed
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Make a timetable for a year.

                            </li>

                        <p>
                            Since these three flows were the most important to design students, my focus was to
                            make
                            these
                            flows
                            as simple and intuitive as possible.

                    <p>

                        User testing highlighted that the information on the course cards was not intuitive and
                        lacked
                        necessary information, such as when the course was being offered. Based on this
                        feedback, I
                        created a final version with better-organised cards and a labelling system to specify if
                        courses
                        fit certain requirements.
