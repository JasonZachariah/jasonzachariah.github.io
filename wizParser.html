                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <h3>The Issue</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my time at WizRobotics, I was assigned to work with a front-end developer to redesign
                        their platform, Wiz Parser - an online interactive teaching platform. This not only meant
                        redesigning elements to create a more unifed look, but creating a new system in place to help
                        future developers of the program to create a consistant style when developing.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="space-y-8" id="step2">
                    <div>
                        <h4>So, what was the problem with Wiz Parser?</h4>
                        <h3>Lack of unity creates confusion</h3>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The developer I was working with had no system in place for designing the different modules in
                        Wiz Parser, instead "designing" them as they were needed, and working off what the previous
                        developer had done before.
                        Without a proper system for creating elements in Wiz Parser, the platform lacked consistency in
                        both appearance and interactivity.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Creating new elements is time-consuming</h3>
                    <p>
                        One complaint I received from the engineer was how tedious it was to create new elements for the
                        modules, as he had to code the CSS for each one from scratch and ensure it didn't interfere with
                        others. This new system had to be flexible and compatible with the existing codebase.

                        <h3>Perfecting handoff</h3>
                        <p>
                            Since I was creating a system for a team with limited experience in Figma, it needed to be
                            easily translatable to development and ensure consistency across all stages. To achieve
                            this, I created a detailed manual listing all components and variants, helping ensure a
                            smoother design-to-development handoff.
                        </p>

                        <p>Here are some of the details I prepared before handoff:</p>

                        <h3>Typography</h3>
                        <p>
                            Typography guidelines were crucial for establishing a clear hierarchy that worked on both
                            desktop and mobile devices. Previously, type styles were chosen based on appearance rather
                            than purpose, leading to inefficiencies when converting them into CSS. By labeling them
                            according to their intended use, developers could easily understand where each style should
                            be applied.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Colours</h3>

                    <p>
                        To create a color scheme that worked in both light and dark modes and was easy to implement, the
                        primary and neutral palettes were defined using the Radix color system. This allowed for
                        straightforward integration into the Parser's code. Afterward, status colors for alerts were
                        also defined for both modes.
                    </p>
                    <img class="greyborder" src="images/wizparser/Colour_Modes.png">
                    <h3>Spacing</h3>
                    <p>As sizing guidelines were not concretely established, developing a consistent style for padding and margins for components was crucial. These spacings were based on the 4-point system, allowing for consistent padding for both mobile and desktop screens.</p>

                    <h3>Assumptions kill productivity</h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the biggest challenges when designing this system was ensuring it was practical for the
                        developers' workflow - especially for those who might use it in the future without my guidance.
                        Collaborating closely with the developer helped me address his feedback, anticipate potential
                        edge cases, and avoid assuming that everything I designed would work seamlessly without
                        adjustment.
