                        <p>
                            For this project,I was assigned to work with a front-end developer to redesign
                            their platform, Wiz Parser - an online interactive teaching platform. This not only meant
                            redesigning elements to create a more unifed look, but creating a new system in place to
                            help
                            future developers of the program to create a consistant style when developing.

                        <h3>Lack of unity creates confusion</h3>
                        <p>
                            The developer I was working with had no system in place for designing the different modules
                            in
                            Wiz Parser, instead "designing" them as they were needed, and working off what the previous
                            developer had done before.
                            Without a proper system for creating elements in Wiz Parser, the platform lacked consistency
                            in
                            both appearance and interactivity.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Creating new elements is time-consuming</h3>
                        <p>
                            One complaint I received from the engineer was how tedious it was to create new elements for
                            the
                            modules, as he had to code the CSS for each one from scratch and ensure it didn't interfere
                            with
                            others. This new system had to be flexible and compatible with the existing codebase.

                    <p>
                        One thing that I learned from my time working at WizRobotics is that devlopers hate adding more
                        work for their plate. I couldn't just create a whole new guildline from scratch, as that would
                        heighten their workload( and make the developers get a headache)
                    </p>

                                <p>
                                    Since I was creating a system for a team with limited experience in Figma, it needed
                                    to
                                    be
                                    easily translatable to development and ensure consistency across all stages. To
                                    achieve
                                    this, I created a detailed manual listing all components and variants, helping
                                    ensure a
                                    smoother design-to-development handoff.
                                </p>

                            <h3>Typography</h3>
                            <p>
                                Typography guidelines were crucial for establishing a clear hierarchy that worked on
                                both
                                desktop and mobile devices. Previously, type styles were chosen based on appearance
                                rather
                                than purpose, leading to inefficiencies when converting them into CSS. By labeling them
                                according to their intended use, developers could easily understand where each style
                                should
                                be applied.

                            <p>
                                To create a color scheme that worked in both light and dark modes and was easy to
                                implement,
                                the
                                primary and neutral palettes were defined using the Radix color system. This allowed for
                                straightforward integration into the Parser's code. Afterward, status colors for alerts
                                were
                                also defined for both modes.

                            <p>As sizing guidelines were not concretely established, developing a consistent style for
                                padding and margins for components was crucial. These spacings were based on the 4-point
                                system, allowing for consistent padding for both mobile and desktop screens.</p>

                            One of the biggest challenges when designing this system was ensuring it was practical for
                            the
                            developers' workflow - especially for those who might use it in the future without my
                            guidance.
                            Collaborating closely with the developer helped me address his feedback, anticipate
                            potential
                            edge cases, and avoid assuming that everything I designed would work seamlessly without
                            adjustment.
