                    <h4>overview</h4>

                    <h3>

                        During my time at WizRobotics, I was assigned to work with an front-end developer on a platform to help redesign their platform for Wiz Parser, an online interactive teaching platform.
                        
                    </h3>
                    <p>

                       
The current developer  I was working with had no system in place for designing the different modules for the Wiz Parser, "designing" the modules as they were needed.


                    </p>

                    <h4>Problems</h4>




                    <h3> Lack of unity creates confusion</h3>

                    <p>

                        Due to not having a system for creating the elements in the Wiz Parser, the platform lacks consistency both in looks and interactivity. Not only did this look visually unappealing, but it created confusion on the end points for each module, creating no distinction between a marked vs unmarked module.

                    </p>

                    <h3> Creating elements from scratch is time consuming</h3>

                    <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>




                    <p>

                        I analysed the three most common tools design students use to plan out their degree-

                        <b> Visual Student Planner, DESN requirements sheet, and digital planners like Notion</b>-
                        and
                        found their ability to complete tasks design students require to plan their degree.

                    </p>


                    <img class="greyborder child md:col-span-2  " src="images/handbook/competitor.png">



                    <p>
                        Each platform had only one or two strong features, forcing students to use multiple platforms to
                        meet their needs. This reinforces frustrations noted in user surveys, highlighting that the main
                        issue with course selection is this split-up user experiences

                        <h4>Problem</h4>
                        <h3>Inconsistent, divided platforms </h3>
                        <p>The DESN Program is a 120-credit program requiring students to plan their courses
                            according to
                            requirements. However, there doesn't exist no system to plan out the degree, requiring
                            students
                            to refer to multiple sources to confirm their degree. This fragmented approach can lead
                            to
                            miscommunication and cause human error in meeting degree requirements.</p>

                        Based on the pain points of the current systems in place, I drew the current user flow
                        based
                        on
                        the student testimonials I gathered to understand where the issues stem from.

                    <h3>Mid-Fidelity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Based on my research, I developed a mid-fidelity prototype of a dashboard that met the
                        revised user journey, allowing for access to all the major flows from the home
                        dashboard.

                    <img class="greyborder " src="images/handbook/midfid.png">
                    <p>The current flow is spread throughout multiple platforms, requiring users to frequently
                        switch
                        between them. To fix this, I created a flow that combines these categories into a
                        single,
                        cohesive experience, allowing users to transition between flows on one platform easily.

                        <p>

                            Since I wanted to test a wide scope of features to improve the work, I gave my
                            mid-fidelity
                            to 3 design students who hadn't used the app, and asked them to :



                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li> Add a course to their year one schedule</li>
                            <li> Check what credits they need completed
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                Make a timetable for a year.

                            </li>
                        </ol>


                        <p>
                            Since these three flows were the most important to design students, my focus was to
                            make
                            these
                            flows
                            as simple and intuitive as possible.

                        <h3>Course Card Design</h3>

                        <p>

                            User testing highlighted that the information on the course cards was not intuitive and
                            lacked
                            necessary information, such as when the course was being offered. Based on this
                            feedback, I
                            created a final version with better-organised cards and a labelling system to specify if
                            courses
                            fit certain requirements.
