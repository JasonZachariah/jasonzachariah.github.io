                    <h3>The Issue</h3>
                    <p>

                        During my time at WizRobotics, I was assigned to work with an front-end developer on a platform
                        to help redesign their platform for Wiz Parser, an online interactive teaching platform.

                    </p>
                    <p>


                        The current developer I was working with had no system in place for designing the different
                        modules for the Wiz Parser, "designing" the modules as they were needed.


                    </p>


                </div>
                <div class="space-y-8" id="step2">





                    <div>

                        <h4>So,what was the problem with the Wiz Parser</h4>
                        <h3> Lack of unity creates confusion</h3>

                    </div>
                    <p>

                        Due to not having a system for creating the elements in the Wiz Parser, the platform lacks
                        consistency both in looks and interactivity. Not only did this look visually unappealing, but it
                        created confusion on the end points for each module, creating no distinction between a marked vs
                        unmarked module.

                    </p>

                    <h3> Creating new elements is time consuming</h3>
                    <p>

                        One complaint that I got from the engineer was how annoying it was to create new elements for
                        the module, as he had to code the CSS for each module from scratch and make sure it didn't
                        interfere with other modules. This new system had to be flexible, and not interfere with the
                        existing coding system in place.

                        <h3>Perfecting handoff </h3>
                        <p>
                            Since I was creating a system for a team with little experience in Figma, my system had
                            to
                            be
                            easily translatable for the development stage and cover all bases to ensure that a
                            consistent
                            system is followed throughout. To achieve this, I create a detailed manual list of all
                            components and variants, which helps create a smoother handoff experience during the
                            design
                            process.

                            Here are some of the details I formatted before handoff:

                        <h3>Typography</h3>
                        <p>
                            Typography guidelines were important to establish, especially when relating to creating
                            type
                            hierarchy that would work both on desktop and mobile devices. Previously, type styles
                            were
                            used
                            based on style, rather than purpose,leading to time wasted when encoding into CSS . By
                            labelling
                            them with titles to show what they were for, it allowed developers to understand where
                            to
                            use
                            each style in the future

                    <p>

                        To make a color schematic that worked for light and dark mode and was easily able to be
                        implemented coding wise, the primary and neutral palette was defined using the Radix colour
                        system, which could be easily implemented into the code of the Parser. After this, status
                        colours for alerts were defined, both for light and dark mode.

                    <h4>Takeaways</h4>

                    <h3>Assumptions kill productivity</h3>


                    <p>


                        One of the biggest challenges when designing this system was making it actually practical
                        for
                        the workflow of the developers using it, especially for those using it in the future when I
                        am
                        not there to give feedback. This is why it was so valuable to have the developer with me to
                        pass
                        along feedback and questions he had about the design, and plan for all edge cases of the
                        design
                        that he might encounter, and not just assume everything I create would turn out smoothly.
